## Seattle_AirBnB_housing_price
#### libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SkLearn
#### Motivations: In this short project, I try to answer the following questions about Seattle Airbnb housing, using the 2016 Kaggleâ€™s data "Seattle Airbnb Open Data":
>when is the high season in terms of accommodation price<br>
>which neighborhood is pricy to stay<br>
>predict the price based on available data using a linear regression model.
#### Summary of the results:
> Found out that the high season is June, July and August<br> 
> Observed the average neighbourhoods price to spot pricy neighborhoods<br> 
> Linear regression models used to predict the housing price with an R-squared of 58%.
#### files: _Airb&b_seattle_housing_ notebook (python3) contains the code and the results
