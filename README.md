## Seattle_AirBnB_housing_price
#### In this short project, I do a simple analysis on Seattle Airbnb housing prices to see when the high season is in terms of travel accommodation and which neighborhood is pricy to stay, and also I try to do a linear regression model to predict the price based on available data.
#### The data used is Kaggleâ€™s Seattle Airbnb Open Data for 2016
#### Python3 is used, and the _Airb&b_seattle_housing_ notebook contains the code and the results: 
> Found out that the high season is June, July and August. Also observed the average neighbourhoods price to spot pricy neighborhoods. Linear regression models used to predict the housing price with an R-squared of 58%.
